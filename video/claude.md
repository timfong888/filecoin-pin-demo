### Context
Create the script with screenshots for a video walkthrough.
The script should align with what is in the `../DEMO_WALKTHROUGH.md` file but more concise
The script should be written in markdown and committed to the repo.
The screenshots should be made using `carbon-now-cli`

### Screenshot formatting
- Those screenshots from scripts will be used on a screen, 16:9.  Make the proportions fit
- Use colors to make the screenshots more readable - follow conventions relates to what is appropriate `bash` or `node.js` coloring conventions
- Be concise, the screenshots will be displayed full screen but treat it as if it were a presentation.  Font size will be big and so fewer words and characters
